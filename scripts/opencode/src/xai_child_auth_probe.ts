/**
 * Prove the child xAI credential against the *installed OpenCode binary*.
 *
 * Jumi hands the child a credential that can call Grok but cannot refresh, so a
 * killed review cannot rotate the refresh grant and take the new token with it
 * (see `src/xai_auth.ts`). That only holds if OpenCode actually sends the
 * shipped shape as a bearer instead of routing it through its own refresh path.
 * A unit test cannot tell: the decision lives in OpenCode's provider loader, and
 * an upgrade can change it silently.
 *
 * How: point the `xai` provider at a loopback server, seed an isolated
 * `XDG_DATA_HOME` auth file with exactly what `childAuthFile` produces, and run
 * the real `opencode run`. Then assert the bearer the provider presented is the
 * access token we seeded, and that the seeded file is unchanged — a refresh
 * would have rewritten it.
 *
 * The fake server does not implement the xAI Responses API, so `opencode run`
 * itself fails afterwards. That is deliberate: the model's answer is not under
 * test, the Authorization header is, and hand-rolling a valid Responses stream
 * would make this probe fail on every ai-sdk change instead of on the one thing
 * it guards.
 *
 * Exit 0 when the credential is presented as a bearer and never rotated.
