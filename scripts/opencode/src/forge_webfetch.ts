 * read the forge over HTTP can pull in issue/PR/Actions state the parent never
 * injected, and act on it. Containment is webfetch only: git push via the
 * credential helper stays allowed, and public upstream docs stay reachable.
 *
 * Prompt prose is a hint, not a control. The rules below are what the
 * binaries enforce: OpenCode through `OPENCODE_PERMISSION`, Claude through
 * `--disallowedTools`, Antigravity through `permissions.deny` in
 * `settings.json`. Derive them here, not in another copy of prose.
 *
 * The host is per-spawn, not compile-time: the forge is configured, and the
 * GitHub factory hands the child `GIT_AUTH_HOST=github.com` with a write-capable
 * token, so baking in the homelab Gitea host would leave that factory open.
