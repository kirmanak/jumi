/**
 * Prove Jumi's production Claude flags against the *installed `claude` binary*,
 * not against the constants that built them.
 *
 * A unit test that compares `claudeArgv()` to `CLAUDE_PERMISSION_MODE` grades
 * itself: it stays green when the binary drops a flag, renames a choice, or
 * starts ignoring a value. In production that shows up as every Claude spawn
 * dying with a generic non-zero exit, or — worse for `--effort` — as a silent
 * downgrade the parent never notices. `claude --version` in the image job does
 * not exercise a single production flag.
 *
 * How: stand up a stub Anthropic-compatible endpoint on loopback, point the
 * binary at it with `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, and run the exact argv `claudeArgv()`
 * emits. Nothing is billed and no request leaves the machine: the operator's
 * `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` is deliberately kept out of the child env, so the
 * probe cannot spend real quota even if one is exported.
 *
 * What the run proves, beyond "the process started":
 *   - the binary echoes back the `permission-mode` and `model` it accepted, so
 *     a value that parses but is ignored still fails here;
 *   - `--output-format stream-json --verbose` still yields the event stream
 *     `ClaudeStreamParser` reads text and token usage from;
 *   - every name in `--allowedTools` is a tool this binary actually has;
 *   - every `--effort` level an operator may configure is still known, since a
 *     level this release dropped only warns and runs at the default;
 *   - `--plugin-dir` is on the argv *and the plugin behind it actually runs*: the
 *     probe stands up a second loopback server as a throwaway Phoenix, points
 *     `PHOENIX_OTLP_ENDPOINT` at it, and requires the run to POST a span
 *     carrying this probe's job id. That is the one link nothing else exercises
 *     — `claude --help` proves the flag is spelled the same, and the hook unit
 *     tests exec `hooks/*.sh` directly, so between them a release that stopped
 *     loading inline manifest hooks (or `--setting-sources user` starting to
 *     suppress them) would leave every homelab Claude run untraced with nothing
 *     anywhere saying so.
 *
 * Then each flag value the binary is able to reject is re-run with a nonsense
 * value and must draw an objection. That is what keeps the positive case
 * honest: a binary that shrugged at `--permission-mode nonsense` would also
 * shrug at a typo in production, and the probe says so instead of passing.
 *
 * Exit 0 when every case matches its expectation, 1 otherwise.
