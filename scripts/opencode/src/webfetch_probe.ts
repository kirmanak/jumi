 * Prove the reviewer webfetch permission map against the *installed OpenCode

 *
 * A unit test that copies `Wildcard.match` grades itself: an OpenCode upgrade
 * can change matching semantics, silently drop the forge-host deny, and leave
 * the copy green. So this probe drives the real binary instead.
 *
 * How: stand up a throwaway OpenAI-compatible provider on loopback that always
 * answers with a single `webfetch` tool call for the URL under test, run
 * `opencode run` against it with `OPENCODE_PERMISSION` set to the exact string
 * production uses, then read back what OpenCode fed the model as the tool
 * result. The same server also serves the fetch targets, so an allowed URL is
 * observed as a real HTTP hit and a denied URL is observed as no hit at all.
 *
 * Exit 0 when every case matches its expectation, 1 otherwise.
