/**
 * Phoenix tracing for `type: claude` runs.
 *
 * An OpenCode child leaves a session sqlite the parent converts and exports
 * after the run (`phoenix.ts`). A Claude child leaves no such database, so the
 * spans have to come from the child itself: the parent passes an image-local
 * Claude Code hook plugin that posts OpenInference spans to Phoenix.
 *
 * The plugin is passed per spawn with `--plugin-dir`, never installed into the
 * checkout or discovered from it, so `--setting-sources user` keeps standing:
 * an untrusted repository still cannot supply hooks. Nothing here is installed
 * at run time either — the plugin is vendored into the image.
 *
 * Everything is fail-open. No endpoint, an endpoint that is not an in-cluster
 * URL, or a missing plugin directory means the child runs untraced; a Phoenix
 * that is down or slow (2s per POST, then skip after 3 failures) is the
 * plugin's problem and never the job's.
